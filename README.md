# 🔒 CipherFlow Analytics  
**Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System with Explainable Machine Learning**

> **Academic Technical Project (9 Credits)**  
> Production-oriented cybersecurity platform for live traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and explainable intrusion analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

**CipherFlow Analytics** is a technical cybersecurity project designed to detect malicious network behavior in real time using machine learning and packet-flow intelligence.

The system captures live traffic, converts packets into bidirectional flows, extracts statistical features, classifies threats using hybrid ML models, and presents live results through an interactive dashboard.

### Core Objectives
- Real-time packet capture from live interfaces  
- Flow-based intrusion detection  
- Hybrid ML classification for known + unknown threats  
- Explainable AI using SHAP  
- Web-based monitoring dashboard  
- Structured alert logging for analysis
